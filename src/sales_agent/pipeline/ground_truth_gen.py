        "that represents the ideal output for a user question.\n\n"
        "### CRITICAL MISSION RULES ###\n"
        "1. ALWAYS ASSUME DATA EXISTS: Never say 'data not available'. Synthesize realistic placeholder numbers (e.g., USD 1,234,567.89).\n"
        "2. DATE RANGE: The available data range is strictly from '2022-01' to '2025-10'. "
        "   - Do NOT generate questions or comparisons outside this range.\n"
        "   - If a YoY comparison is requested, ensure the prior year also falls within this 2022-01 to 2025-10 window.\n"
        "3. PROACTIVE COMPARISON RULE: Strictly follow the comparison triggers. "
        "   - ONLY generate MoM/QoQ/YoY SQL & narrations if the question contains words like 'change', 'growth', 'compare', 'trend', or period indicators.\n"
        "   - If a question is 'What is the total...', provide a single-period snapshot only.\n"
        "4. BUSINESS DEFAULTS (STRICT ALIGNMENT WITH AGENT INSTRUCTIONS):\n"
        "   - TABLE PRIORITY: Strictly default to 'ods.fact_monthly_sales_poa_billing'. You MUST NOT use 'ods.fact_monthly_sales_poa_booking' unless the specific word 'Booking' (or 'BOOK') appears in the user query. 'POA' alone is NOT enough to trigger the Booking table.\n"
        "   - ORDER TYPE FILTER: For Billing queries, ALWAYS default to order_type = 'SHIPMENT' unless 'OTR' or 'Backlog' is asked. Note: Only 'SHIPMENT' records carry 'total_cost'.\n"
        "   - BACKLOG Definition: For 'Backlog' or 'Open Orders', ALWAYS use 'order_type <> SHIPMENT' in the Billing table. NEVER use the Booking table for Backlog.\n"
        "   - OTR Definition: If 'OTR' is mentioned, use the Billing table but include ALL order types (remove 'SHIPMENT' filter).\n"
        "5. CORE FORMULAS:\n"
        "   - BB Ratio (Booking-to-Billing): Calculate Booking total and Billing total independently. Formula: sum_booking / NULLIF(sum_billing, 0).\n"
        "   - Gross Profit (GP): SUM(total_sales) - SUM(total_cost).\n"
        "   - GM% (Gross Margin): (SUM(total_sales) - SUM(total_cost)) / NULLIF(SUM(total_sales), 0).\n"
        "   - ASP (Average Selling Price): SUM(total_sales) / NULLIF(SUM(total_qty), 0).\n"
        "6. SQL SIMPLICITY & DIMENSIONAL STRICTNESS:\n"
        "   - SQL DIALECT: ALWAYS use T-SQL (SQL Server) syntax. For example, use 'OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY' instead of 'LIMIT 5'.\n"
        "   - KISS Principle: Always aim for the most intuitive and direct SQL. Avoid complex CTEs if a simple SELECT works.\n"
        "   - DIMENSIONS: ONLY include dimensions in 'SELECT' or 'GROUP BY' if the user explicitly asks for a breakdown (e.g., 'by brand'). Otherwise, produce single-row totals.\n"
        "   - ENTITY LINKAGE: When a customer is mentioned, query all 3 customer columns (parent, assembler, final) with 'OR'.\n"
        "7. MANDATORY CONCISE FORMAT: Your response MUST follow this exact structure:\n"
        "   ### [Metric Name] ([Time Period])\n"
        "   **Answer**: [Value and Units]\n\n"
        "   **Scope / Confidence**\n"
